# btsg-wavs

An authentication contract validated an BLS12_381 signature, specifically for validating actions to take from transactions broadcasted by AVS operators.

 
## TODO
 
-- integration tests
-- threshold signature
-- update pubkey set 

## Forming Authentication Requests Msgs

The following table describes the properties and definitions of the `AuthenticationRequest` object.

| `fee_granter` | `Addr` \| `null` | The address that granted the fee. | [Addr](#addr) |
| `fee_payer` | `Addr` | The address that pays the fee. | [Addr](#addr) |
| `msg` | `Any` | A message of any type. | [Any](#any) |
| `msg_index` | `uint64` | The index of the message. | - |
| `sign_mode_tx_data` | `SignModeTxData` | Data for signing the transaction. | [SignModeTxData](#signmodetxdata) |
| `signature` | `Binary` | The signature of the transaction. | [Binary](#binary) |
| `signature_data` | `SignatureData` | Data related to the signature. | [SignatureData](#signaturedata) |

## Aggregated Keys
Top implement support for bls12 signature verification,  we make use of the `SignatureData`  to provide all pubkeys and all their singatures in an arrays. The message of these singatures should be passed into the msg  property, as the `Any` type.
